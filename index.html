            <p>Commence with the number of fingers gracing your hands, then deduct the primary-color hues of the rainbow's bands. Multiply by the faces carved on Mount Rushmore in stone, add the Olympic rings, in color count alone.</p>
            <p>Take twice now this sum, a mere bridge to the grand, and then add the number of continents to this noble strand. Multiply by days in a week plus one more to be best, then subtract a modern year's total digits, sorry to put you to the test.</p>
            <p>Add the total years in a century to this grand parade, then, finally, deduct English alphabet letters minus one, and your number wonâ€™t fade.</p>
